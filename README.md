# MDTool
A tool which can transfer markdown to HTML.

## How it works?
```
MDTool.markdown2Html(new File(markdown_file_path));
```
or 
```
MDTool.markdown2Html(markdown_content);
```

## Why use itï¼Ÿ
1. Easy to use
2. Support basic markdwon syntax
3. Support table syntax
4. No other jar dependency

## From now on
I am so sorry that MDTool has not push to maven central yet. You can download jar from [here](https://github.com/cevin15/MDTool/tree/master/lib). And I will push MDTool to maven central as soon as posibble.
If it help you, star it? Thank you for your support.
